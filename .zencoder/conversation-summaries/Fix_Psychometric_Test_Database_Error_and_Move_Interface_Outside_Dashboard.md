## Complete Conversation Summary
This conversation addressed critical issues with a psychometric test system where AI-generated questions were successfully created but a database error was preventing test session creation. The user reported server logs showing successful AI question generation (40 questions for an M&E Impact Officer position) but requested ensuring the test interface was outside the dashboard for full-screen space and displayed real AI questions instead of mock data.

**Primary Issue Identified**: The main problem was a MongoDB duplicate key error (`E11000 duplicate key error collection: coachinghub.testsessions index: sessionId_1 dup key: { sessionId: null }`). Investigation revealed a stale database index on `sessionId` field that didn't exist in the current TestSession model, causing insertion failures when trying to create test sessions.

**Database Fix**: I created a comprehensive database migration script (`fixTestSessionIndex.ts`) that:
- Connected to the MongoDB database using environment variables
- Identified and removed the problematic `sessionId_1` index from the `testsessions` collection  
- Cleaned up any documents with obsolete `sessionId` fields
- Verified the fix by checking final index state
- Successfully executed, removing the conflicting index

**UI/UX Architecture Improvement**: The user requested moving the test interface outside the dashboard for better space utilization. I restructured the application routing:
- Moved psychometric test routes from `/app/take-psychometric-test` (inside dashboard layout) to standalone `/take-psychometric-test` route
- Updated App.tsx to include standalone protected routes for both test-taking and results pages
- Modified navigation logic in PsychometricTestsPage.tsx to redirect to the standalone route
- Ensured the interface provides full-screen experience without dashboard sidebar/header constraints

**API Endpoint Corrections**: I discovered and fixed API endpoint mismatches in the SimplifiedTestTaking component:
- Corrected start test endpoint from `/api/psychometric-tests/start/` to `/api/simple-psychometric/start/`
- Fixed submit test endpoint from `/api/psychometric-tests/submit/` to `/api/simple-psychometric/submit/`
- Verified these matched the backend route registrations at `/api/simple-psychometric`

**Real Data Verification**: I confirmed the test interface was already properly configured to display real AI-generated questions from the database rather than mock data:
- Question count, duration, and job title pulled from actual test session data
- Questions rendered from `testData.questions` array containing AI-generated content
- Answer options mapped from real database question objects
- No hardcoded or mock questions found in the implementation

**Current Status**: The system is now functioning correctly with the database index issue resolved, test interface moved to standalone full-screen layout, API endpoints properly aligned, and confirmed display of real AI-generated questions. Users can successfully generate tests, navigate to the full-screen test interface, and complete assessments with actual AI-generated content specific to their selected job positions.
