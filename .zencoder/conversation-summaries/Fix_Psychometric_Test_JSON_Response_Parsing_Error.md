## Complete Conversation Summary
The user encountered a critical bug in their psychometric test submission feature where the frontend was throwing "SyntaxError: Failed to execute 'json' on 'Response': Unexpected end of JSON input" errors. This indicated that the backend was sometimes not returning valid JSON or returning empty responses when test submissions were processed.

I implemented a comprehensive multi-layer solution addressing both backend and frontend issues:

**Backend Improvements:**
- Enhanced the `simplePsychometricController.ts` to explicitly set proper Content-Type headers (`application/json; charset=utf-8`) for both success and error responses
- Added JSON serialization validation before sending responses to catch circular reference errors or other serialization issues
- Restructured the response data to use a more compact format, removing large arrays that could cause JSON truncation
- Implemented robust error handling that ensures JSON responses are always sent, even when exceptions occur
- Added comprehensive header setting including `Cache-Control` and `X-Content-Type-Options` for security

**Frontend Improvements:**
- Refactored the `SimplifiedTestTaking.tsx` component to use the `simplePsychometricService` instead of raw fetch calls, providing better error handling and retry logic
- Enhanced the `api.ts` service with improved response interceptors that can handle malformed JSON strings, empty responses, and null/undefined data
- Added automatic JSON parsing for string responses and fallback error responses for parsing failures
- Implemented comprehensive retry logic with exponential backoff for JSON parsing errors, network timeouts, and server communication issues
- Added user-friendly error messages that distinguish between network failures, server errors, and JSON parsing issues

**Testing and Validation:**
- Created extensive test suites covering all error scenarios including server timeouts, empty responses, malformed JSON, network failures, and large response data handling
- Fixed Jest configuration issues (corrected `moduleNameMapping` to `moduleNameMapper`)
- Successfully validated backend JSON response handling with 9 passing tests
- Created isolated test configurations to bypass MongoDB setup dependencies

**Technical Approach:**
The solution implements multiple layers of protection against JSON parsing errors: proper header setting at the backend, response validation before sending, client-side response interception and parsing, and comprehensive error handling with retry logic. This ensures that even if one layer fails, the others provide fallback mechanisms to handle the error gracefully.

**Current Status:**
All backend improvements are implemented and tested successfully. The frontend code has been updated with proper error handling. The JSON parsing errors should now be resolved through the combination of guaranteed valid JSON responses from the backend and robust error handling on the frontend.
