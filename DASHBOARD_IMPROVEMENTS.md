# Dashboard & Profile Improvements

## ✨ Key Enhancements Made

### 🔧 **FIXED: Profile Update Navigation Issue**
- **Problem**: Clicking "Update Profile" was redirecting users back to dashboard due to role restrictions on `/app/profile/professional` route
- **Root Cause**: ProfessionalProfilePage was restricted to users with `PROFESSIONAL` or `JOB_SEEKER` roles only
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated all profile completion navigation to use `/app/profile?edit=true` instead of restricted route
  - Added automatic edit mode detection in ImprovedProfilePage using `useSearchParams`
  - Page now automatically enters edit mode when `?edit=true` parameter is present
  - URL parameter is cleaned up after edit mode is activated
- **Result**: All users can now access profile completion regardless of their user role (STUDENT, ADMIN, etc.)
