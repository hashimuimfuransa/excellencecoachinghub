## Environment Variable Recommendations

To ensure proper URL configuration in production, set these environment variables:

### Production Environment Variables
```env
NODE_ENV=production
JOB_PORTAL_URL=https://exjobnet.com
BACKEND_URL=https://ech-w16g.onrender.com
FRONTEND_URL=https://exjobnet.com
HOMEPAGE_URL=https://excellencecoachinghub.com
ELEARNING_URL=https://elearning.excellencecoachinghub.com
```

### URL Resolution Priority
The updated code now follows this priority order:
1. Environment variable (if set)
2. Production domain (if NODE_ENV=production)
3. Localhost (for development)

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Production-Ready URLs**: All email links now point to correct production domains
2. **Environment-Aware**: URLs automatically adjust based on NODE_ENV
3. **Fallback Safety**: Proper fallbacks for different environments
4. **Enhanced Security**: Comprehensive security headers and rate limiting
5. **Consistent Email Experience**: All email templates use consistent domain URLs

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test job recommendation emails in production
2. Verify auto-apply links work correctly
3. Test unsubscribe functionality
4. Confirm all email links point to correct domains
5. Verify security headers are properly set

## Notes

- The changes maintain backward compatibility for development
- No database changes required
- All email functionality should work correctly in production
- Security enhancements provide better protection against common attacks
