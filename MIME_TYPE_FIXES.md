# MIME Type Issues Fix

## Problem Analysis

The errors you're seeing indicate that static assets (CSS, JS files) are being served with the wrong MIME type (`text/html` instead of their correct types). This happens because:

1. **Overly broad rewrite rules**: The server redirects ALL requests (including static assets) to `index.html`
2. **Relative path issues**: React builds with relative paths when `homepage: "."` is set
3. **Missing MIME type headers**: Server doesn't explicitly set correct MIME types

## Root Cause

When you navigate to `/dashboard/admin`, the browser requests:
- `https://excellencecoachinghub.onrender.com/dashboard/static/css/main.0333844d.css`
- `https://excellencecoachinghub.onrender.com/dashboard/static/js/main.fc194b8a.js`

But the server's rewrite rule catches these requests and serves `index.html` instead of the actual CSS/JS files.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Render Configuration (`render.yaml`)
```yaml
routes:
  - type: rewrite
    source: "/((?!static|manifest\\.json|favicon\\.ico|.*\\.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|eot|ico)).*)$"
    destination: "/index.html"
```

This regex excludes static assets from being rewritten to `index.html`.

### 2. Fixed React Build Configuration
```json
"homepage": "/"
```

Changed from `"."` to `"/"` to ensure absolute paths in the build output.

### 3. Added Explicit MIME Type Headers
```yaml
headers:
  - path: "/*.js"
    name: "Content-Type"
    value: "application/javascript"
  - path: "/*.css"
    name: "Content-Type"
    value: "text/css"
```

### 4. Updated Build Command
```yaml
buildCommand: cd frontend && npm install --legacy-peer-deps && PUBLIC_URL=/ npm run build
```

Ensures React builds with absolute paths.

### 5. Enhanced Redirect Rules (`_redirects`)
```
# Static assets should not be redirected
/static/*  /static/:splat  200
/*.js  /:splat.js  200
/*.css  /:splat.css  200

# Fallback for client-side routing (everything else)
/*    /index.html   200
```

### 6. Improved Apache Configuration (`.htaccess`)
```apache
# Don't rewrite static assets
RewriteRule ^static/ - [L]
RewriteRule \.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|eot|ico|json)$ - [L]

# Rewrite everything else to index.html
RewriteRule ^ index.html [QSA,L]
```

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
1. ✅ Static assets will be served with correct MIME types
2. ✅ CSS and JS files will load properly
3. ✅ Page refreshes will work without breaking styles
4. ✅ Direct URL navigation will work correctly
5. ✅ Manifest and favicon will load properly

## Testing

To verify the fixes work:
1. Deploy the changes to Render
2. Navigate to any route (e.g., `/dashboard/admin`)
3. Refresh the page
4. Check browser DevTools Network tab:
   - CSS files should have `Content-Type: text/css`
   - JS files should have `Content-Type: application/javascript`
   - No 404 errors for static assets

## Debugging

If issues persist, check:
1. Build output in deployment logs
2. Network tab in browser DevTools
3. Response headers for static assets
4. Console errors for any remaining MIME type issues

The key insight is that SPA routing rules must be specific enough to exclude static assets while still catching all application routes.
