# Recording and Session End Fixes - COMPREHENSIVE UPDATE

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Recording Stop API (POST /api/video/recording/stop) - 400 Error

**Problem**: 400 error when stopping recordings
**Root Cause**: Validation was marking `recordingId` as optional when it's actually required

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Split validation into separate schemas for start/stop operations
- ✅ Made `recordingId` required and non-empty for stop operations
- ✅ Updated route definitions to use correct validation
- ✅ Added comprehensive debugging logs to identify validation failures
- ✅ Updated HMS service to try both live-streams and beam APIs
- ✅ Added frontend validation to check recordingId before sending request
- ✅ Added user-friendly error messages and alerts

**Files Modified**:
- `src/routes/videoRoutes.ts` - Fixed validation schemas
- `src/controllers/videoController.ts` - Added debugging and validation
- `src/services/hmsVideoService.ts` - Updated API endpoints and fallback logic
- `src/middleware/validateRequest.ts` - Added detailed error logging
- `frontend/src/components/Video/LiveClass.tsx` - Added frontend validation and debugging

### 2. Teacher End Session Functionality

**Problem**: Teachers couldn't see clear "End Session" option and recordings weren't saved
**Root Cause**: Missing endpoint implementation and unclear UI

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Created `endSession` controller function with recording handling
- ✅ Added proper authorization (teachers can end their own sessions)
- ✅ Integrated with HMS room ending
- ✅ Added attendance tracking and session data saving
- ✅ Added validation for all request parameters
- ✅ Added debugging logs
- ✅ Updated UI to show "End Session" tooltip for teachers
- ✅ Added confirmation dialog for teachers
- ✅ Auto-stop recording when teacher ends session
- ✅ Automatic recording URL saving to session

**Files Modified**:
- `src/controllers/liveSessionController.ts` - Added endSession function with recording handling
- `src/routes/liveSessionRoutes.ts` - Added route and validation
- `src/services/hmsVideoService.ts` - Imported for room ending
- `frontend/src/components/Video/LiveClass.tsx` - Updated UI and added confirmation

### 3. Recording Video Saving

**Problem**: Recorded videos weren't being saved to sessions
**Root Cause**: Missing integration between recording stop and session data

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Added automatic recording URL retrieval when stopping recordings
- ✅ Integrated recording URLs with LiveSession model
- ✅ Added automatic course content creation from recordings
- ✅ Added recording metadata tracking (size, duration, etc.)
- ✅ Added fallback handling for failed recording saves

**Files Modified**:
- `src/controllers/liveSessionController.ts` - Added recording URL handling
- `src/models/LiveSession.ts` - Already had recording methods
- `src/controllers/videoController.ts` - Enhanced recording stop with URL saving

### 4. HMS API Integration

**Problem**: 404 errors from HMS API
**Root Cause**: Using wrong API endpoints

**Fixes Applied**:
- ✅ Updated to use regional HMS endpoints (`prod-in2.100ms.live`)
- ✅ Added fallback logic to try both live-streams and beam APIs
- ✅ Improved error handling and logging
- ✅ Added proper request/response debugging

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/hmsVideoService.ts` - Updated all recording methods

## API Endpoints

### Recording Control
- `POST /api/video/recording/start` - Start recording (teachers/admins)
- `POST /api/video/recording/stop` - Stop recording (teachers/admins) ✅ FIXED
- `GET /api/video/recording/:recordingId` - Get recording details

### Session Management
- `POST /api/live-sessions/end` - End session (teachers/admins) ✅ NEW

## Request/Response Examples

### Stop Recording
```json
POST /api/video/recording/stop
{
  "sessionId": "optional-session-id",
  "roomId": "optional-room-id", 
  "recordingId": "required-recording-id"
}
```

### End Session
```json
POST /api/live-sessions/end
{
  "sessionId": "optional-session-id",
  "roomId": "optional-room-id",
  "startTime": "2024-01-01T10:00:00Z",
  "endTime": "2024-01-01T11:00:00Z",
  "attendance": [
    {"peerId": "peer1", "joinTime": "...", "duration": 3600}
  ],
  "recordingId": "optional-recording-id",
  "participants": [
    {"id": "peer1", "name": "Teacher"}
  ]
}
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify fixes:
```bash
node test-recording.js
```

## Next Steps

1. Test the recording stop functionality in the frontend
2. Test the session end functionality when teacher leaves
3. Monitor logs for any remaining issues
4. Verify HMS API responses are handled correctly
