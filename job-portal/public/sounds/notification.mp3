# This is a placeholder for the notification sound file
# In a real application, you would place an actual MP3 audio file here
# You can use sounds from https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/ or record your own
# Example sounds:
# - A gentle "ding" or "chime" sound for regular notifications
# - A more prominent sound for urgent notifications
# - Different sounds for different types of notifications (message, connection, etc.)

# For now, the browser will gracefully handle the missing audio file
